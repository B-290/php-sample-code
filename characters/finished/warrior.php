      <p>Warrior is a common character class (or job) found in many role-playing games. This class is also popularly referred to as the Fighter, as in Dungeons & Dragons. The class is may sometimes be referred to as a Knight or Bruiser, although in some games Knight is a separate class with a more defensive or support based aspect. Warrior character's skills are centered around strength and physical combat with a wide variety of melee weapons, and the ability to survive while tanking for the group, usually at the cost of agility or range. To aid in this, they can potentially use of some of the most powerful armor and weaponry in the game. As such, a Warrior is a well-rounded physical combatant, but because of the class's reliance on heavy plate armor and expensive weaponry, the cost of managing the Warrior's equipment is typically very high. In some games, the Warrior (or more often the Knight, if it is a separate class) may be able to learn basic magic, but its capabilities in this field are somewhat limited. </p>
